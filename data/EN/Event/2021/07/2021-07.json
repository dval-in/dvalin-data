However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.</p><p>Having read many military treatises from all over Teyvat since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and materiel, its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi&#39;s tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island&#39;s various factions.</p><p>&#34;Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here,&#34; has become a common popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.</p><p>However, few people know that Kokomi&#39;s biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.</p><p>To reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img class=\"ql-image\" src=\"https://upload-os-bbs.hoyolab.com/upload/2021/07/22/1015537/553b0c558f0b0b551b1d47374e7fb320_947858903210824386.jpg\"></p>",
