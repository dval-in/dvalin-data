  "description": "A long time ago, the people of the Lord of Deserts carved these imperial insignias based on robust beetles to memorialize the bright sun that marked the shifting of day and night, as well as the infinity of such times.<br/>Though the name of that Lord is no longer mentioned, these imperial insignias have been preserved through time, each bearing a faint ambiance of those past glories.<br/>These insignias travel with the descendants of the Eremite Tribe, silently telling the tales of their then-Lord.",
