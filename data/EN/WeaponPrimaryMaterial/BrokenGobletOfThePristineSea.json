  "description": "Legend says that when the first usurper came to the primordial sea, the first sovereign gave him a goblet of water. Later, he became the unquestioned god-king, and used this goblet of water to refine the mysterious drops of dew, establishing a splendid and powerful empire. But that is now an ancient story, whose main characters now sleep in the phosphorescence of the schools of the deepwater fish.",
