  "description": "During the war with the dragons, that mastermind of all the tribes — the same one who had hidden his face behind a mask — deciphered the golden patterns on the non-human ruins for the warriors. The knowledge with which he did so is now long lost.<br/>It was from their enemies that he learned the language and thought patterns required to do this. For him, wielding these skills against them was perhaps a deeply satisfying act of revenge.<br/>Yet his unconcealed hatred for them was a recurring cause of great concern among his fellow heroes.",
