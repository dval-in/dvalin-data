  "description": "In ancient times, shamans, priests, or those known as mystics were always on the hunt for methods by which they could communicate with the silent underground realm. Ever since the Wayob gradually began to manifest, reacting to the resonance between the lone hero and the Nightsouls, this had been so. Entrancement, disembodiment, and theurgy were the main methods they chose, each accomplished through the aid of meticulously polished ritual tools.",
