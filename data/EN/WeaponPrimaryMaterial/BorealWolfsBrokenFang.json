  "description": "The wolf pack also understands that humans are not solitary creatures. The honorary broken tooth is a parting gift said to bring protection and luck. In the legends of a far-off world, a female wolf once adopted two great humans. Their home was known as the Cave of Wolves, or Lupercal - that word meaning the same thing as Lupical does in this world.",
