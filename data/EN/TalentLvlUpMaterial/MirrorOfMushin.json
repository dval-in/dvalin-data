Nor is the mirror a means to shut out the looks of judgment from onlooking people, but is rather a bulwark against this base and sullied world. Within this great temple shall punishment be meted out and ignorance be cleansed.<br/>Dreams shall be overturned, desires shall be cut away, and karma shall be reset.",
