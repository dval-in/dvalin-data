  "description": "Offering up kindling is the established rule of the Nation of Pyro. To acquire a certain amount of something, one must first pay the corresponding price. Sometimes, you may end up paying too much to obtain something; while other times, you may pay too little, and lose it as a result. Understanding how to strike this balance between giving and receiving is one of the meanings of offering kindling.",
