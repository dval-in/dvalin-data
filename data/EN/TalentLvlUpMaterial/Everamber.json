But for said life, this was fate.<br/>Following the heaven-sent disaster, wood, vines, roots, and all manner of flora withered and turned to dust. A great many life forms disappeared.<br/>But in the stillness of amber, a nameless insect endures in this otherworldly oasis, reaching a future that no others of its kind could.",
