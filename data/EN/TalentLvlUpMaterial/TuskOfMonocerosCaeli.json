  "description": "It is said that the shape of one's constellation determines one's character. The image of a whale cruising across the celestial heights represents a solipsism that seeks to crush and devour all in its path. Embracing this aspect of himself, Childe gleefully summoned one such beast before throwing himself into battle against you.",
