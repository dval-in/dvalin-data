  "description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Natlan. A specialty rod of the Natlan Fishing Association. Crafted from weapons-grade metal, it has also been carved with a fine design that features Long-Necked Rhinos and Flowcurrent Birds, ensuring both durability and style. Anglers often speculate that, if only it felt inclined to harness the potential of its exceedingly long neck, the Long-Necked Rhino might become the most gifted fisher in the entire natural world. Meanwhile, the seemingly clumsy Flowcurrent Bird actually has to rely upon catching fish to survive. Together, therefore, they would make the perfect fishing partners â€” thus, having them both on the same rod is believed to bring anglers exceptional luck!",
