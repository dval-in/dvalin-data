  "description": "A rare and valuable butterflyfish variant from Inazuma. It loves water bodies suffused with Electro, and seems to derive joy from electric currents.<br/>It is said that these fish were once from the same line as the Abiding Angelfish of Liyue, until traveling merchants exported them to Inazuma. There, their behavioral patterns underwent an unexpected shift. At present, some researchers have begun to use them in conjunction with Electro Slimes for experiments.<br/>\"Ma... Mah... Mah tung ith numm...\" â€” A certain greedy gourmet after trying a Raimei Angelfish dish.",
