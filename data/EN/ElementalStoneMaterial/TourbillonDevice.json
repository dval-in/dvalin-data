  "description": "A precision-machined mechanical component that counteracts the effects of gravity via high-speed rotation. The revolution speed is so fast that it is almost impossible to capture with the naked eye.<br/>Throughout its long history, the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering has always warred against a flood that once washed countless lives away, and may yet cover the earth and sky one day far in the future, searching for a means to survive.<br/>Arkhium, with its immense energetic potential and power to shatter the shackles of the earth, was once considered the key to the gate of salvation.",
