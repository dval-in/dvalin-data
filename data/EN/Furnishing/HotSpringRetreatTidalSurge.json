  "description": "Constructed from reliable \"White Chestnut Oak Wood,\" this semi-open structure is crowned with a striking yellow sunshade, intended to provide an ideal retail space for individual merchants. \"Atlahua's Net\" serves as a classic example. The wavy canopy not only offers excellent sunshade and ventilation but also visually evokes the sensation of \"sailing through waves,\" imparting a sense of vitality and coolness. Such designs are commonly seen on the rooftops of buildings within the \"People of the Springs.\"",
