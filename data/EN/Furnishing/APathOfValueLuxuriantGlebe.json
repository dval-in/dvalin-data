  "description": "An orderly field that is saturated with Sub-Space Creation energy. The fertile soil has almost unlimited nutrition, and thus seeds planted here will grow into excellent flowers in time without much need for intensive care. However, flowers planted here will tend to put long roots down, so you cannot put too many of them in here if you wish to give them all sufficient room to grow.\\nThe following seeds, spores, and samples obtained from the Seed Dispensary may be planted here: Silk Flower, Cecilia, Glaze Lily, Windwheel Aster, Qingxin, Violetgrass, Naku Weed, Sumeru Rose, Lumidouce Bell, Rainbow Rose, Brilliant Chrysanthemum.",
