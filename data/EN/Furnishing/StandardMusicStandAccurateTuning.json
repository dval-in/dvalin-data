  "description": "This music stand, though simple and unadorned in appearance, is sturdy, reliable, and extremely durable.\\nIn some novels, exceptional musicians will often rely on memory to play and improvise when inspiration strikes. Readers unfamiliar with instrumentation may instinctively believe that consulting sheet music during a performance is \"unprofessional\" or a sign of being \"not familiar enough with the melody.\" In reality, few if any musicians can remember every last detail in hundreds of pieces of music. For larger performances with a diverse repertoire, a music stand is an indispensable tool.",
