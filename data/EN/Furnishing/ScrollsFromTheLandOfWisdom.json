  "description": "A bookshelf often found in the House of Daena that contains large numbers of Akademiya-approved books. These shelves are rather narrow, and are usually used in combination with other shelves.\\nThese shelves are embedded into the wall, making maintenance difficult. They are also very tall, and scholars often require a ladder to reach the topmost shelf. In addition, all parts of the shelf must endure heavy loads. As a result, these shelves have been crafted with thick boards that have been specially processed to resist tear and wear.",
