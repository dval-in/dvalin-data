  "description": "A standard ground light of Fontaine that incorporates a metal-glass composite structure and boasts the ability to illuminate a considerable area. These lights are not only used in the Court of Fontaine as supplementary lighting at ground level but are also placed in some outdoor areas, providing emergency light sources for members of the Maison Gardiennage on duty. The casings and glass for outdoor models are reinforced, and they feature ample space for the power source. They are notably weighty, and a clockwork meka is typically required to lift them after the suction cup has been detached from the base.",
