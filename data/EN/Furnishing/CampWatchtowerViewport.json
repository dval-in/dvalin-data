  "description": "A watchtower like the ones seen in the Kujou Encampment. It has excellent sightlines that allow it to survey the surrounding areas clearly, but it does lack some cover and defensive capacity, and you never know when an arrow with your name on it will come flying in from afar. Additionally, it can be tricky for soldiers wearing heavy armor to climb up and down the tower, so some just prefer to jump down. After all, who knows? You might just injure yourself in the process and get to report sick.",
