  "description": "A three-layered tea rack made from reliable, economical Bamboo Segments and Fragrant Cedar Wood, often used to store the bamboo sieves that hold tea leaves.\\nSome report that this inclined design has the advantage of allowing the tea leaves to dry more fully while allowing staff to check on the tea leaves' status better than flatter designs would allow. However, the large size and specialization of this tea storage rack makes it ill-suited to small-town tea farmers, and can usually only be found at Chunming Teaworks, which has enough storage space to start with.",
