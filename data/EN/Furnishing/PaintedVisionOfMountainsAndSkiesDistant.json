  "description": "A traditional Inazuman hanging picture showing distant mountains and clouds against vast skies.\\nThe canvas used in such paintings are exceedingly supple and can be compared to the finest silks and satin while still maintain an inexpensive price point, the reason for which is that the fabric processing method has its origins in the Kamisato Clan itself.\\nIt is said that over a century ago, the Kamisato Clan Head bent much thought to use painting and calligraphy to improve the cultural lives of the common folk. To lower the bar required to take part in such activities, this clan head hired textile artisans and developed a variety of processes that lowered the cost of the consumables involved in painting and calligraphy, such that ordinary citizens did not need to worry about such expenses.",
