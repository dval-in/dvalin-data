  "description": "An arched fence adorned with intricate patterns, seemingly conveying profound wisdom.\\nIt is said that the five semicircular metal rings embedded within the fence correspond to the five stages of the sun's trajectory from rising to setting, hence the name \"Sun's Journey.\"\\nJust as the sun follows its predetermined path, so all things should adhere to their own rules. Any action that goes beyond these rules may invite unforeseen risks, such as crossing a fence and leaping off the cliffs. This might be the deeper meaning that explains why the Masters of the Night-Wind decorate their fences with such patterns.",
