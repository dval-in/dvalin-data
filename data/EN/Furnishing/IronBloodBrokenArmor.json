  "description": "A weapon rack placed inside the Blacksmith. The three weapons displayed are in different lengths and take into account the mercenaries' various body types and fighting styles. In addition, each weapon specializes in tackling a different target: the spear and halberd can be used against unarmored enemies from a certain distance, while the sledgehammer on the far left can be used to efficiently pierce through an opponent's armor.\\nBut moving around in a suit of armor is an unwise choice whether you're in the humid rainforest or scorching desert. Due to the lack of armored enemies and the inconvenience of wielding polearms, most mercenaries prefer using smaller weapons, so the sales for these three weapons have not been ideal.",
