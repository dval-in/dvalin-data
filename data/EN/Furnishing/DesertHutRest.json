  "description": "A hut that may be found in Aaru Village. It is especially small, and craftsmen have specially set up a folding mechanism at the frame joints such that this entire setup can be folded up quickly and carried away by a Sumpter Beast — all the better to be able to set up a hut at fixed points in one's trek and rest for a while...\\nHowever, due to the greater waterproofing on this particular type of hut, it will often cause the Sumpter Beast that carries it to feel unbearable heat, and some merchants would rather suffer under the sun for a while longer than burden these poor creatures any further. But during such times, Sumpter Beasts do also use their bodies to block the sunlight for these merchants, thus providing a measure of shade.",
