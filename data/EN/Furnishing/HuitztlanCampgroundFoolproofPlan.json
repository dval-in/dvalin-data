  "description": "A specially styled medium-sized shed featuring dual side canopies, favored by merchants within the \"Scions of the Canopy.\" When operating their shops, merchants generally need to address two key issues: first, ensuring the shed's wind resistance to cope with potential strong winds; second, providing moisture and sun protection for their goods. Through extensive practice, an economically effective solution was found â€” adding rain canopies to smaller, wind-resistant fabric shelters to enhance their wind resistance and protection against moisture and sun.",
