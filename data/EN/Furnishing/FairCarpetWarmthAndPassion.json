  "name": "Fair Carpet: Warmth and Passion",
  "description": "A round carpet with a simple pattern, made from high-quality wool and dyed with warm-toned phlogiston-based pigments, featuring a centrally symmetrical design with a comforting warm orange hue. Orange, being the color most commonly associated with phlogiston, the outer flames of a fire, and sunlight, is believed by some to bring people warmth and peace. For this reason, such carpets are often placed in dining rooms or bedrooms to imbue these spaces with a sense of passion and warmth.",
