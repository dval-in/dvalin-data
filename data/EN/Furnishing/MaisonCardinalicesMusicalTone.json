  "description": "A gramophone found often in venues such as the Palais Mermonia, used to help employees relax and improve their working state. Capable of storing sound for long periods, it faithfully reproduces music with great clarity. Given the high expense of the sound storage medium and the potential for wear and tear after repeated use, music is not played continuously. Most people consider the moment the gramophone is turned on to herald the arrival of a rare time of enjoyment.",
