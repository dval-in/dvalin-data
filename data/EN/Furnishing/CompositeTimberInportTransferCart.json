  "name": "Composite Timber In-Port Transfer Cart",
  "description": "A large cart often seen in Port Ormos. It has a wide base and an exceptional loading capacity. Only a few of these carts are needed to carry a common cargo ship's entire load. Unfortunately, the diameter of their wheels is quite narrow, and they can only move around smoothly on paved roads. Thus, these carts are mostly used for the transfer of goods within Port Ormos and are rarely seen out in the wilderness.",
