  "description": "A stall made from High-quality Otogi Wood, from which festival accessories or decorations are sold at popular festivals.\\nThe artisans in charge of making these items tend to play it safe and make only a small number of items each time. Thus, the more popular products tend to sell out fast, with latecomers being forced to wait for another event to come along before they can try their hand at snagging them again. As time passed, the hottest commodities would slowly become \"teiban,\" or \"regular fixtures,\" at the stalls.",
