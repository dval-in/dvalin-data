  "description": "A medium-sized residence shaped like a long boot, a common housing style seen within the \"Children of Echoes.\"\\nIt is said that this unique architectural design originated from the numerous cliffs and dramatic elevation changes within Tequemecan Valley. In such an environment, residents expanded their living space vertically, akin to extending long boots in the vertical direction. The solid rock walls within the gorge provided ample support for the \"shaft\" of the \"long boots,\" ensuring the house's foundation and load-bearing structure are supremely reliable, without the risk of toppling due to instability, as with actual long boots.",
