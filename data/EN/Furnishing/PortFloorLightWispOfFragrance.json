  "description": "A simple Liyue floor lamp with a traditional wood frame design that is light and durable. The frame of this type of lamp uses Fragrant Cedar Wood, and when the wick burns, the rising temperature will heat the wooden frame, causing the resin within the Fragrant Cedar Wood to evaporate, emitting a light aroma. This fragrance not only repels insects and fleas, but also has a slight cough suppressant effect. For those reasons, this style of cheap and effective floor lamp is popular throughout Chenyu Vale.",
