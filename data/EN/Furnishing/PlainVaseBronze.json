	"description": "An evenly glazed utensil, whose surface almost resembles that of exquisite porcelain. It was further painted with some bronze patterns, granting it a touch of luxury. After Sumeru merchants introduced the method of making Liyue porcelain, the corresponding method of glazing porcelain was also introduced in response to people's demand for finely detailed appearances of utensils.\\nAt first, glazing Sumeru pottery in this ancient Liyue style was incredibly expensive. To glaze a handful of such pottery cost as much as making nearly a hundred pottery pieces. Nevertheless, a few years ago, a certain traveling merchant, with her marvelous connections — her almighty supplier, to be precise — found a cheap method most suitable for Sumeru, thus reducing the cost of glazing tremendously. Only then did glazed pottery become a common sight in Sumeru.",
