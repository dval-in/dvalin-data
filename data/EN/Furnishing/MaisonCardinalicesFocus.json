  "description": "A desk custom-made for the employees of the Palais Mermonia. Every single dimension has been validated by ergonomic theory and is in perfect accordance with the usage habits of most people, with a wide and flat top providing ample space for the user.\\nIt is worth noting that this desk is exceptionally heavy and is generally unaffected by vibrations. Even if other employees are moving nearby, or a Gardemek passes, the vibrations are rarely transferred to the user, allowing them to maintain undisturbed focus.",
