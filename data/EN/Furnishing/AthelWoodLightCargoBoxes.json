  "description": "Boxes made from Athel Wood planks that have undergone simple processing. One could never call this \"high quality,\" but it is built very simply and is quite cheap â€” all one needs to do is collect some dry wood along the way and lash them together using sturdy ropes to produce such boxes in bulk. Their lack of artistry is no obstacle. After all, no one will look at such a thing with high expectations for its life expectancy.",
