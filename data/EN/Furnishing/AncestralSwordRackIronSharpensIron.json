  "description": "A sword rack once used by some Inazuman swordmaster. The two swords placed parallel to one another seem identical and will sometimes be used by two samurai. The relationship between such pairs is often quite close, with them being siblings or even friends who eat and sleep together, and who urge each other on in the advancement of their technique.",
