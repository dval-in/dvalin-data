  "description": "A mask with colors reminiscent of a Yumkasaurus that can be found for sale at stalls in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame's Chuwen Fair. It is said that the grappling devices widely used today by the people of Natlan were inspired by the manner in which Yumkasaurs climb. As such, some stories associate Yumkasaur Masks with resourcefulness and intelligence.",
