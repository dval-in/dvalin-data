  "description": "Huts built around the square by vendors during the Lantern Rite Festival. The frames are made from Sandbearer Wood with incipient decay and covered with an ultramarine roof. The six lanterns hanging high are particularly eye-catching. According to some vendors, the lanterns hanging high against the blue roof have a symbolic meaning of \"prosperity for your offspring\".",
