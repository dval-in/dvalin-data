  "name": "Linden Wood \"Sweet Slumber\" Bed",
  "description": "A bed made from high-quality Linden Wood. Each plank is machine-processed, the mattress is stuffed with smashed and re-pressed plant material, and its aesthetics and user experience get top marks from Fontainians, bringing sweet slumber to every Fontainian home. Additionally, the price point of these beds is quite affordable, to the point where experienced salespeople often say, \"Well, even if you were trading cartons of Fonta for this, it wouldn't take too many!\" to any hesitant customers.\\nThose unused to such sales pitches might thus let their guard down on account of hearing this vague comparison, though in truth, the correct rejoinder would simply be: \"So, how many cartons is 'too many,' anyway?\"",
