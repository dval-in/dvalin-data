  "description": "A low railing made of \"Ashen Aratiku Wood,\" with two soft ropes attached, found in the Flower-Feather Clan. Contrary to common perception, the tribe intentionally leaves some slack in the wooden posts and ropes when installing these railings, rather than fixing them firmly in place. This design increases wind resistance, extending the railings' lifespan. Additionally, the ropes act as a safety net for Saurian riders during emergency landings, helping to reduce injuries from direct impact.",
