  "description": "A most curious hot air balloon that has used the Floral Chess pieces from the Windblume Festival as their point of reference, this one shaped like one of the Winged Dendroshrooms attached to a Mottled Terrace.\\nUsually, edible mushrooms have rather soft caps, causing some researchers to become curious — though Fungi are quite dangerous, their attacks are quite varied. Could their less-used caps, in fact, be rather soft? Some researchers have even posted strange commissions for people to help them \"verify the strength of a Fungus's headlong charge.\" Unfortunately for them, no adventurers or mercenaries have entertained such requests thus far.",
