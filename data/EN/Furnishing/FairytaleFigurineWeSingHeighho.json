  "description": "A figurine that depicts vividly the figure of miners at work. Can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display.\\nThey say that miners' working chants are often accompanied by short, powerful shouts, a process that has caused them to develop loud and rugged voices. It was amidst such cries that cartloads of ore were transported from the Toytanium Mines, where they shaped the Constellation Metropole as all know it today.",
