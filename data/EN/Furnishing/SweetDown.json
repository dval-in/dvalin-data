  "description": "Large plant pots found throughout Natlan that house a rosette-shaped herb. Their most notable feature is their succulent, sap-filled leaves. Legend has it that if the flower stalk is cut before the plant blooms, one can extract its sweet nectar. Through fermentation and distillation, this liquid can be made into a potent spirit, fiery as a Qucusaur's flames. Hence why, among connoisseurs of fine liquor, this plant has earned itself the affectionate nickname \"Sweet Down.\"",
