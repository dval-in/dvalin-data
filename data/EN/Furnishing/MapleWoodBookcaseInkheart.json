  "description": "A bookcase that can be found in the Yashiro Commission Headquarters. It is made from Maple Wood and has a fair balance of dimensions and work-hours used to build it. It is somewhat lacking in the space department, though.\\nIt is said that Inazuman artisans are skilled at maximizing the revenue they get out of every resource and save on the amount of materials used in anything they build. This type of bookcase is a classic example â€” the lacquer used on this wood has a deep color and contains harmless byproducts derived from the ink-making process.",
