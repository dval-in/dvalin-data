  "description": "These walls that creatively utilize recycled metal as material can be found in Poisson. Although the reliability and strength of this construction method may be questionable, its extremely low cost is sufficient to offset all the aforementioned drawbacks.\\nIt is said that in Poisson, which is exceedingly damp, traditional materials like wood and bricks struggle to withstand the assault of moisture. This not only poses maintenance problems but also risks attracting pests. Recycled metal, on the other hand, can be replaced more frequently at a lower cost. Therefore, it has become the mainstream material of choice for construction in Poisson.",
