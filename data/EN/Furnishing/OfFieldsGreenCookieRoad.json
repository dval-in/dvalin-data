  "description": "The stone pavement of the garden known as \"Of Fields Green.\" It is made from clean and bright stones that are also secure and stable. It can be used to pave outdoor courtyards.\\n\"Of Fields Green\" draws inspiration from fairy tale wonderlands. Some of these stories — often popular ones — include spirits who eat rocks, and so children often find these rock pavements quite unique and call them \"spirit cookies.\"",
