  "name": "Half-Constructed Fence",
  "description": "A simple fence that is somewhat more than half-built. It is only missing one wooden pole, and shouldn't take much time to complete. Usually, such interruptions in work are a result of monster attacks that force the workers to clear out in a hurry. And when they return, the monsters will often have made off with the pole that would have been used to finish the fence, rendering the work incomplete.",
