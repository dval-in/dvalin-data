  "description": "A brazier meticulously carved from the finest volcanic rock, adorned with special painted motifs and an ornate base inlaid with luxurious metal fittings. Burning away with a solemn dignity, these braziers can be seen near the main pathways within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.\\nNatlan is the Nation of Flame, where flames are not only a symbol of belief but also a source of inspiration. Thus have its people placed braziers along the main pathways, within the Stadium itself, and in the Speaker's Chamber, ensuring that all significant events are witnessed by the watchful flames.",
