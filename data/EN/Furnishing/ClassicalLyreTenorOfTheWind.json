  "description": "The lyres of Mondstadt are famous and known to be both small and compact. This one is a little larger than most as it draws from more ancient designs that can be dated back to the Decarabian's era.\\nIt is said that this lyre was once borrowed by a certain bard and tuned using special harmonic rules to the point where even outstanding players cannot comprehend it.\\nBefore a skilled tuner can return it to its original state, it can only be used for home decoration.",
