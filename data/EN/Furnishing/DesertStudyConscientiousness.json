  "description": "A low desk in the shape of wooden steps. It has a long and narrow desk top, on which not many items can be placed, and one must be extra careful to avoid knocking them off.\\nIt is said that this is a deliberate design - the desert climate sometimes gets so harsh that people have very limited time to move around freely. As a result, they must plan thoroughly before making a trip. The compact design can lead people to reflect on the purpose of what they are using and to put it back to its original position when they are finished. The craftsmen believe that in the long run, this might subtly influence the way people plan their actions.",
