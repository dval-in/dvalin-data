  "description": "A rack made of light but sturdy Adhigama Wood that has different fish hanging off it. Some anglers place these racks in noticeable spots outside their houses to show off good catches. It can spread the \"Harvest Luck\" and encourage their neighbors.\\nIf processed improperly, the fish on the rack will turn unusually hard and make differently-pitched sounds. Some fishermen even use them to play simple music.",
