  "description": "Scarlet-painted Yumemiru Wood was used in the creation of this shrine building, and it is of the same design as the one where you draw Fortune Slips. According to common practice, the shrine maidens who work here year-round will also rest in these buildings. So if you were to find one such place with its door locked tightly when you visit, please refrain from disturbing its occupants.",
