  "description": "A simple yet aesthetically pleasing medium-sized shelter built with a unique \"Flammabomb Wood\" frame, found within the Masters of the Night-Wind.\\nSome members of the tribe believe that allowing nature to take its course, without engaging in unnecessary interference, is the best way to preserve its true state.
