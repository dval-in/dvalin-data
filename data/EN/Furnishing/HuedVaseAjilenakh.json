  "description": "A uniquely-shaped container of considerable volume that has been dyed Ajilenakh Nut green. It has the unique ability to allow grape wines from Mondstadt to \"breathe.\" Some local wines tend to produce some sediment, which is then poured alongside many bottles of said wines into containers of this kind and shaken to evenly distribute. Some free-spirited mercenaries have used these containers as a way of judging someone's capacity for alcohol. Someone capable of drinking it all will have their respect, but this is also sometimes the result of incidents.",
