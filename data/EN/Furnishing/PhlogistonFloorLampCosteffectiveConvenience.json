  "description": "A low-cost floor lamp that uses a brazier-like metal base. It can be found within the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. It is said that the original intent behind this design was to replace some of the small braziers used in the Stadium. With sources of fire come safety concerns and the requirement for dedicated maintenance staff. In contrast, using phlogiston for light sources skirts such issues. To minimize costs, the artisans chose to repurpose braziers into lamp bases, ultimately giving us the floor lamp design we see today.",
