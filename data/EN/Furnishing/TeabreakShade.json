  "description": "A parasol made from a frame of Adhigama Wood and red cloth. It has a counterweight at its base, making it quite steady, and is often placed outside caf√©s and restaurants to provide shade for guests. Even if the customers get too much of a kick from their wonderful coffee and shuck their inhibitions, they won't be able to knock this parasol over so easily...",
