  "description": "A seemingly mysterious furnishing often seen in the forest. All that is needed for building it are several large leaves placed over a simple wooden frame. It is said that these furnishings can be used for attracting Shroomboars, drying fish, and raising Dusk Birds. Place flame retardants below it for safety, light a small fire, and it will work perfectly well as a convenient barbecue grill. Thus, the Forest Rangers often place these furnishings around their camps.",
