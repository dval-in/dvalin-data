  "description": "A dueling table with cards and other necessities commonly seen at The Cat's Tail. Its tablecloth is layered in patterns of floral green, resembling the design of a meadow.\\nFor the so-called \"player-philosophers\" of Genius Invokation TCG, almost anything displayed on the table can influence one's mental state. The brightly colored tablecloth could hint that one should try to use more Elemental-related strategies, like unleashing the power of Dendro in accordance with the green of the cloth...\\nHowever, veteran players will stress that players must stick to their playstyle and that temporary deviations, along with being so easily swayed to change one's habits are signs of wavering conviction, and betrays one's \"Duelist's Soul\"!",
