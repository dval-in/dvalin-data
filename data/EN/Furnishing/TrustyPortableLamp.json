  "description": "A light and practical lamp that gives off a warm light and shines for a long time, but which also attracts the curiosity of the children.\\nNo thanks to the Cavalry Captain's jests, a rather morbid children's tale exists in Mondstadt concerning these lamps. The nuns have had to explain to the kids that no, these lanterns do not contain the imprisoned souls of fireflies.",
