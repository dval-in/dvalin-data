  "description": "Medium-sized boxes that can be found at Fontaine harbors, stacked upon a pallet for easy transportation. They are sturdy, simple, and cost-effective.\\nInitially, Fontaine's shipping units were split into three types — Compact, Standard, and Large. The middle set of dimensions was designated as \"Standard,\" and theoretically refers to a pallet of six medium-sized boxes that one clockwork meka can push alone — greatly increasing transportation efficiency.",
