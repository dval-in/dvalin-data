  "description": "A crane from Port Ormos. Its frame is made from processed Adhigama Wood, and a special mechanism powers its winch, giving it an impressive lifting capacity. All cargo ships entering Port Ormos are unloaded using this crane.\\nIn the last hundred years or so, Kshahrewar researchers have been attempting to popularize the use of construction machinery, and this crane was one result of their project. While increasing its lifting efficiency, the crane also takes up very little space and shares many foundational components with other structures in the area. Therefore, it doesn't require a specialized technician to repair, which greatly lowers its construction and maintenance costs. Moreover, these cranes allow Port Ormos to accommodate a higher volume of cargo influx through an increased deployment rate while keeping the budget unchanged.",
