  "name": "Fruit and Veggie Stall: Harvest Bounties",
  "description": "A stall that sells fruits and vegetables, with the various products separated into their own wooden frames, almost like a neatly divided field. Clever merchants tend to use such arrangements to show off the variety and freshness of the produce they are selling.\\nConsidering that some of their customers need to buy in bulk, this design is also conducive to carrying such large orders off at one go.",
