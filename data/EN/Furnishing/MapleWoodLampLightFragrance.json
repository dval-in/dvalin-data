  "description": "These beautiful lamps are placed around the Yashiro Commission Headquarters. There are thin, long air-holes hidden in corners of their wooden frames, and a small stone bowl meant to store balms that sublimate easily into steam is mounted above its candlestand. Once this lamp is lit, the clear aromas will diffuse into the air, contributing to greater wakefulness and clarity. These balms also tend to be a good deal cheaper than entire scented candles, which are uncommon in Inazuma anyway.",
