  "description": "A type of dwelling that can be seen on the western side of Mont Automnequi. The structure adopts a traditional mix of wood and masonry, and is designed so that the kitchen and furnace share the same chimney.\\nDue to the humidity in Fontaine, things can get very damp indoors, so some people living in the wilderness light the furnace and use it to dry out their homes rather than stay warm. However, in the Court of Fontaine itself, it is forbidden to discharge completely untreated waste emissions.",
