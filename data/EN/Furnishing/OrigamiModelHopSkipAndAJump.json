  "description": "Tubby combined Paimon's description of your adventures in Simulanka with her own imagination to create this model of an origami frog, bursting with energy. Speaking of paper frogs, your first impression of them was naturally their readiness to hop and jump and full-throated singing. Alas! The Realm Within lacks the power unique to Simulanka, and thus, the paper frogs here hop, skip, and jump in name only.",
