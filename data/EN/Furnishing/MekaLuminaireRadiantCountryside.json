  "description": "The standard outdoor streetlight in Fontaine, commonly seen along roads in the wilds. These lights have a unique four-segmented lamp post design with a distinct arc. This is designed to withstand impacts from wildlife, such as Armored Crabs lured by the light from shallow waters. If a streetlight is damaged, its damaged components can be replaced instead of requiring an entirely new lamp post, effectively reducing maintenance costs.",
