  "description": "A hilichurl-style hut. It seems like a castle that's been locked up tight, but it is in fact quite airy and even has gaps in the roof through which rain may enter.\\nThe scholar, Musk, pointed out that these gaps can be used to collect rainwater, and that indoor pots may be set up inside such structures.",
