  "description": "A table-and-chair structure used in stage sets. The combination of solid Fragrant Cedar Wood and sturdy purple fabric can be used as a proxy and metaphor for a variety of things and helps with some theatrical expressions.\\nAs it is a piece of specifically-made stage equipment, the height of this structure is rather exaggerated. When Yun Jin was young, she didn't quite understand what these were used for. She thought that she found it difficult to climb up these tables and chairs steadily because she was not good enough, and thus decided to practice some footwork, inadvertently improving her basic skills.",
