  "description": "A tall and sturdy weathervane that comes with a huge windmill and special tail. It is said to not only be able to accurately tell the windspeed of sea breezes but also accurately indicate wind direction. Often seen on the outskirts of Constellation Metropole.\\nDue to the complexity and variability of sea breezes, almost every home outside of the Metropole has such a weathervane to better monitor real-time changes in the weather. They stand at attention at the door of every home, like soldiers ready to do battle at a moment's notice, earning them the nickname \"Windcatcher Sentinels.\"",
