  "description": "A simple mailbox made from sturdy Mallow Wood and metal parts. As it has a very small footprint, it won't get in the way when installed near the gate. It has great storage capacity, not only allowing letters to easily be left within but also small packages to be stuffed inside. Thus, it is also a kind of \"storage\" box.\\nHowever, placing packages into the mailbox may result in damage to said package, so it is not recommended that you do so.",
