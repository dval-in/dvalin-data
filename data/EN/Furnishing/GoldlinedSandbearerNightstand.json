  "description": "A Liyue-style nightstand built from the wood of the Sandbearer tree. Its four legs are wrapped in metal that makes it as sturdy as it is lovely.\\nDrawer space here is quite sizable indeed, being enough to even contain a catalyst for self-defense, all the better of the owner of the house to counterattack when roused from sleep. It is said that this design was popularized by a biography of successive Tianquan tenures.",
