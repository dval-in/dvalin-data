  "description": "An origami flower ball model so seemingly delicate that it might burst if touched. Can be placed on a \"Good Shelf\" for display.\\nThe vivid flower ball is a great target for use during flight. In fairytales, the flying squirrels flew between just such targets to conquer the streaming wind, eventually carving out a corner of the skies for themselves.",
