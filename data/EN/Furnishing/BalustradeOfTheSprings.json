  "description": "Low railings adorned with water-colored graffiti, connected by soft ropes to stone pillars, are frequently seen in the \"People of the Springs.\" In the relatively serene and leisurely atmosphere of the commune, protective railings generally have little use. Thus, the tribe's railings are intentionally kept low, reducing their obstruction of the surrounding views, and using the graffiti to blur the boundaries between water and buildings, allowing individuals to better immerse themselves in the beauty of the landscape.",
