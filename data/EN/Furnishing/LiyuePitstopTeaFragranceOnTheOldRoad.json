  "description": "A Liyue-style building with an extra entrance and exit. Its space is limited, but if properly furnished, it will have no problem dealing with even a large influx of guests. Business outposts often use this particular design. Merchants on a long journey will come here to rest their feet and have a pot of hot tea, before continuing on their way with a nice warm feeling inside.",
