  "description": "This simple street lamp has not been fitted with a ceiling, and as such, its lantern can in fact be extinguished when there is heavy rainfall. Fortunately, these lamps are not usually situated in places where many people live or along key roads, but in places where festivals are held like Amakane Island. Ill weather suits activities there ill, and so the lamps shall need not be lit anyway.",
