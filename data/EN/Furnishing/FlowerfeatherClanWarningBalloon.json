  "description": "A simple yet durable balloon model, equipped with stabilizing weights, primarily used to monitor changes in air currents. These balloons can be seen floating in the airspaces around the Flower-Feather Clan.\\nIt is said that airflow can vary significantly within the same airspace. Sudden, undetectable gusts of unstable air can easily cause accidents. Skilled flyers keep a watchful eye on these floating balloons, using them to anticipate hidden dangers in the sky.",
