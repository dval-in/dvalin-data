  "description": "A short and sturdy street lamp that can be seen around Aaru Village. According to some, a warm light coming from below one's line of sight can inherently induce drowsiness in people. Thus, such placement of these street lamps encourages villagers to go to bed earlier. In the desert where the night is drastically cooler than the day, doing so also prevents them from getting colds.",
