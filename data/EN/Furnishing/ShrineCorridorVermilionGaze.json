  "description": "A crimson-painted corridor corner made from Yumemiru Wood, it makes for a fine pair with the Sakura-Dusted Path, and together, they bring forth the image of the high mountain pathway that leads up to the Grand Narukami Shrine.\\nIf you look out southward from the Narukami Shrine, Inazuma City, visible out in the distance, doesn't seem to have changed in the last century at all.",
