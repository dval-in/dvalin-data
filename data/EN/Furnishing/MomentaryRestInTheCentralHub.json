  "description": "A grand and luxurious large sofa, equipped with cushions that are soft yet adequately firm, designed to quickly alleviate the user's fatigue and provide maximum support for their waist and back. It must be extremely pleasant to relax and enjoy tea while sitting on such a comfortable seat.\\nIt is said that the Duke often sits on this type of sofa to indulge in leisurely tea breaks. This is one of his many techniques for maintaining physical and mental well-being amidst the busy affairs of the Fortress of Meropide.",
