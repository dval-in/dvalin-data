  "description": "A round table often seen in the restaurants, taverns, and cafes of Sumeru City. Made from fine Karmaphala Wood, it's commonly placed outdoors together with some chairs. It's not intended to serve large parties of diners, but provides a place for patrons to enjoy some casual drinks and conversation after the main meal is over.",
