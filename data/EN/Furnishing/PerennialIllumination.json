  "description": "Street lamps seen everywhere in Sumeru City. Using the Self-Modulating Light Source designed by Kshahrewar scholars, it can maintain optimal illumination for an extended period with minimal need for replenishing the luminescent materials. The lamp and the lamppost are metallic, supposedly made when the Akademiya was processing extra ores. Thankfully, most Sumeru residents won't be strongly repulsed by metallic items as long as they aren't carried around on their person.",
