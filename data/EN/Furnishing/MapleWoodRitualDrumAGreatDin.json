	"name": "Maple Wood Ritual Drum: A Great Din",
	"description": "A drum displayed in Komore Teahouse that can be used for both ritual ceremony and playing music. The sound it makes is deep enough to penetrate wooden walls and wake the whole town, so it has slowly come to be used for other strange purposes by those outside the field of professional music. Take the shrine maiden, Kano Nana, for instance.\\nOnce, when Nana was looking for a certain skiving Shuumatsuban ninja, she beat this drum as she walked through the woods where her quarry was hiding, at last blasting the lazy ninja till she fell out of a tree and was captured on the spot.",
