  "description": "A hut of very simple make that can be found within Merusea Village. The amount of material used is also quite low, such that a single Melusine can easily construct this.\\nLegend has it that this shelter was intentionally built by a somewhat older Melusine to ensure water from waterfalls or cave moisture would not get her little sisters' precious items utterly soaked. In her own words, this is part of her \"duty to take care of everyone.\"",
