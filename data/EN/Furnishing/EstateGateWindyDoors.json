  "description": "The main courtyard gate of the Refined Estate, which derives its aesthetic from Inazuman traditional designs.\\nThe vast majority of doors in Inazuma City are not particularly heavy. There is, after all, little need to beware of burglars if the city's security is excellent.\\nAdult males inclined toward criminal acts tend to be of the particularly large and sturdy sort and have already been specially marked by the Shogunate for service as reserve troops, thus rendering them quite reluctant to act rashly.",
