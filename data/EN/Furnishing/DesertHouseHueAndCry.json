  "description": "This building that may be found in Aaru Village has a smaller floor area and can be used to store tools or miscellaneous goods, or as a shelter from the assault of the sands. Due to its simpler make, the guards can also use it as a resting spot while they are on sentry duty.\\nIt is said that in the early days, Aaru Village was already ringed with a fixed number of sentries on the alert for the perils of the desert. If a sandstorm was coming, these outer guards would raise the alarm as quickly as possible. However, such a watch was a rather hard one to keep up. As the people of the village grew more familiar with the principles governing changes in the weather, and with the accession of a Guardian of unprecedented might, the guards no longer need to go too far from the village on their sentry duties.",
