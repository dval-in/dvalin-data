  "description": "A column made using high-quality Sandbearer Wood, decorated using light but sturdy colored ribbons. As they flutter in the wind, they resemble long flowing clouds, and in the lights of the lanterns, they resemble a rainbow hanging low in the sky. Mixing and matching such columns together to dot festive grounds allows them to further adorn festive nights.",
