  "description": "A multi-purpose low table modified to serve as a temporary workbench. This can be found at some stalls at Chuwen Fair. Although this workbench has only the most basic functionality, its lightweight design has earned it a place on the market. Some vendors at the Fair are traveling merchants who, so they say, create products in their own tribes and only come to the market to sell them during competitions and festivals. For such vendors, the portability of a workbench is more important than any additional features.",
