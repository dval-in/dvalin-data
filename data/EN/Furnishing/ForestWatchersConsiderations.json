  "description": "A specimen plate made from Brightwood that contains many specimens reflecting on the current state of the rainforest's biome. These specimens had usually perished naturally or by accident, and were handed over to the Forest Watcher for analysis after being found by Forest Rangers. Ideally, the Forest Watcher would discern any environmental fluctuations of the region from details reflected in the specimens, and make preparations ahead of time.",
