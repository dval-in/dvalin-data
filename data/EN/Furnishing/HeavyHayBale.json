  "description": "A typical hay bale that is a common sight in the countryside. It is surprisingly heavier than it appears, and the bale is neatly rolled in a perfectly round shape.\\nTravelers from Snezhnaya are often puzzled by the sight and wonder how the people of Mondstadt and Liyue could make such objects without the help of the farming machinery which they take great pride of in Snezhnaya.",
