	"description": "An Offering Box in Seirai Island. Although it is also made from the core of Yumemiru Wood, unlike the Offering Box at the Grand Narukami Shrine, it does not have a scarlet lacquer finish, but rather retains its original simple wood color.\\nAlthough Seirai Island is off the beaten track and no one knows what the donations accumulated in the Offering Box are used for, the most important thing for those who come to pray is to express their sincerity. Mora, which was exchanged with the people's hard work, sweat, and time, is indeed the most tangible item in this regard. The cats seem to think so too.",
