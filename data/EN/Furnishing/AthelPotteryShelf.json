  "description": "A shelf made from Athel Wood. Its surface was treated using a special technique, making the whole shelf water absorbent to some extent. Not only is it resistant to moisture in the rainforest, it also has an increased service life when placed in the desert. These shelves are mainly used for storing pottery, and are sometimes placed indoors as display shelves.",
