A replica of the stone statues that can be found around Petrichor.\\nThough it completely lacks the combat capabilities of golems, the stone statue's majestic appearance alone is enough to repel bandits with wavering hearts. Naturally, even if it should fail to scare them off, you needn't worry, for The Realm Within doesn't seem to have much of a bandit problem anyway...",
