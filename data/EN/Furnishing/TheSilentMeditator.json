  "description": "A large wooden chest often found in the domains of the Masters of the Night-Wind. Crafted from thick planks of \"Flammabomb Wood,\" it is remarkably sturdy. The surface, especially the lid, is finely polished, making it not only smooth and beautiful but also suitable for use as a workspace or storage. Legend holds that its greatest feature is its exceptional seal â€” whether exposed to harsh weather or struck by external force, its contents remain unaffected, much like a meditative master unmoved by the chaos of the outside world.",
