  "description": "A commonly seen market tent in Sumeru City. It is relatively wide, making it an ideal addition to long rectangular-shaped stalls. Both light-transmitting fabric and regular fabric are draped over its frame, allowing the store owner to keep their goods in different areas as needed. Fruits that require sunlight to maintain their flavor could be placed under a sunlit area, while non-perishable goods such as nuts and spices could be placed under the shade.",
