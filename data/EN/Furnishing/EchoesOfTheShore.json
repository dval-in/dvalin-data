  "description": "A potted plant that can be found in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. It has a unique blue shade with large leaves and a rigid trunk. When the wind blows by, the leaves will sway in the wind, as if responding to its song. The blue color of the plant itself reminds people of a leisurely, cozy beach, hence the name \"Echoes of the Shore.\"",
