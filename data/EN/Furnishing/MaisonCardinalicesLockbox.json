  "description": "A surpassingly ordinary-looking chest, it is actually a costly product of the Beaumont Workshop. It is said that this storage chest has functions that resist damage from blunt force, being shaken or jolted, water damage, and fire damage, among many others. In fact, in some situations it will not only automatically alert the Gardes, but it can also be used as a shield or a tool to break glass in emergencies. However, neither the artisans of the Beaumont Workshop nor the staff of the Palais Mermonia have ever commented on the veracity of the rumors.",
