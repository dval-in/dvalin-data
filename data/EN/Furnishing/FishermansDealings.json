  "description": "A booth made from Adhigama Wood. As simple as its structure is, it is quite durable against both bad weather and pests. Such booths can be set up along the shores of rivers so that vendors can do business directly with people onboard ships. These booths can also be installed in challenging landscapes. With their easy setup and accessible materials, such booths are welcome among vendors in Gandharva Ville and Vimara Village.",
