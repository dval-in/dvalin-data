  "description": "A towering and impressive wooden windmill, typically used to measure wind speed and direction, is one of the iconic structures of the \"Scions of the Canopy.\"\\nIt is said that contrary to the stereotypical image of recklessness, the \"Scions of the Canopy,\" passionate about extreme sports, places great emphasis on safety and rationality. They understand that only by challenging oneself under optimal conditions can one break through personal limits. The windmills, continuously monitoring weather conditions in the heart of the tribe, serve as \"signposts\" to help find the opportune moment.",
