  "description": "A dueling table with cards and other necessities commonly seen at The Cat's Tail. The tablecloth is decorated by a lightly colored map, with its expanse detailing a lake, some land, and an island.\\nFor the so-called \"player-philosophers\" of Genius Invokation TCG, almost anything displayed on the table can influence one's mental state. A map could cause them to throw up more Location Cards to aid their efforts, becoming an \"external factor\" of influence for the match.\\nOf course, veteran players think this is mostly bunk. \"Playing cards is about playing cards. Stop thinking about things outside the game!\"",
