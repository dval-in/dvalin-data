  "description": "A stall that sells parasols.\\nAlthough the design and culture of using parasols came from Liyue into Inazuma, the latter does not lack for talented craftspeople and artists. Over the centuries, Inazuma gradually developed a culture of using parasols that is uniquely its own.\\nIt is said that young people are meant to have different practices and rules when it comes to the color in this regard when meeting acquaintances, friends, or those whom they fancy. However, due to these rules being overly complicated, the practice never truly caught on.",
