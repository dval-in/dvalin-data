  "description": "A very low desk built using Athel Wood with a very thin finish. It is beautiful and affordable, and can often be found adorning special interior areas in the desert regions. In the eyes of some visiting outsiders, this is no different from having a table atop your bed. Some do not like to have such objects around when they are sitting down cross-legged, but others see the friendly and casual atmosphere it creates as an important thing.",
