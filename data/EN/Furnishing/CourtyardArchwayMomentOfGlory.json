  "description": "The arched gate of the Illusory Annex adopts classic Fontainian architectural design, adorned with various meticulously designed reliefs and accessories to resemble an art gallery entrance.\\nIt is said that in the past, people would carve the history of their family into reliefs on such archways, thereby showcasing the glory of their family. Nowadays, even though people no longer make reliefs as they did in the past, they still choose to decorate gates or lintels to express respect for significant moments or special occasions.",
