  "description": "A semi-open building with a high-efficiency smelting furnace built in the same style as the Beaumont Workshop. Its purpose is obvious at a glance. It is said that this building was designed with sufficient space for the installation of automation equipment, with various connections and pipeline channels reserved to make future upgrades to the production equipment much easier, resulting in the entire structure being modular to some degree.\\nAdditionally, the Court of Fontaine has adopted strict standards on waste emissions, so the chimney-like structures above workshops are actually equipment that filters and pressurizes waste emissions, and stores them in liquid form. The residue and gas emission from smelting is processed multiple times to remove all harmful substances for reuse in the production of slag cement â€” a common construction material in Fontaine. Material produced in this manner only requires a rest period and a suitable coat of paint to make them completely harmless to the human body. It's a perfect example of proper resource recycling.",
