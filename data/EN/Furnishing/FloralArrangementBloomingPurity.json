  "description": "A floral arrangement featuring a type of large flower with one of the most pronounced fragrances in the Court of Fontaine. The freshly-picked flowers are arranged in a bold and lively manner, brimming with vitality. Rumor has it that the inspiration for this arrangement was a woman leaping from on high in the Court of Fontaine while clutching an umbrella. When the florist witnessed such a vivacious spectacle, they were deeply moved, leading to the creation of this widely acclaimed masterpiece.",
