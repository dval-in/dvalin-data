  "description": "Signboards made of metal frames and durable Cypress Wood boards, featuring highly visible upward indicators, which can be seen in the Fortress of Meropide. Although newcomers often question the necessity of such signboards, arguing that distinguishing between up and down is easy even without additional indicators, it is said that the guards think otherwise. After all, when there are clear signs, any act of \"getting lost\" becomes deliberate on the part of inmates.",
