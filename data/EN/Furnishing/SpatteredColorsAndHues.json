  "description": "A model based on a freshly opened paint bucket, inspired by the daily creative lives of Natlan's people. According to some Natlanese artistic traditions, an open paint bucket symbolizes an ongoing process or something in continuous development. Such models are often used to set off incomplete graffiti or designs featuring only simple outlines, imbuing the scene with a sense of continuity and motion.",
