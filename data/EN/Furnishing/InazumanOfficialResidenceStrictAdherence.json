  "description": "The height and splendor of this mansion is only surpassed in all of Inazuma by Tenshukaku itself, and as something that imitates the Kanjou Commission Headquarters, it is the equal of its Yashiro and Tenryou Commission counterparts.\\nThe Kanjou Commission, stationed in Ritou, is a symbol of the rule of law in Inazuma. The officials of the Commission emphasize doing things by the book, and payments are to be made in accordance with regulations. This is how it should work in principle, but unfortunately, the laws of Inazuma may as well be muddy water to guests from overseas, and most outlander merchants steer clear of this austere mansion.\\nFortunately, a major incident that occurred recently has brought with it the chance for anyone's voice to reach Tenshukaku. There is also now, at last, a chance for full transparency in terms of how various services and payments work in Ritou.",
