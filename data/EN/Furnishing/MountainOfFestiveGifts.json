  "description": "A somewhat haphazardly-placed pile of popular goods that can be found at stores and stalls during Lantern Rite. Here you can find fireworks and firecrackers, beloved by the children, beautifully-wrapped cakes, and lovely decorations. Some residents will keep these exquisitely-made wrappers with them to remember the unique celebrations that take place every year.",
