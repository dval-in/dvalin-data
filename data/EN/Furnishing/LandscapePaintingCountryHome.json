  "description": "This a painting of the countryside that one can find in the corner of some restaurant. The details could still stand to be perfected, but the brush strokes are practiced and the color palette is fresh and vibrant, surely the work of a master.\\nStrangely enough, not one artist within Mondstadt would claim that this is their work. Could it be something that Mondstadt General Goods imported from overseas?",
