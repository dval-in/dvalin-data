  "description": "This unique street lamp has vines coiling all over it, with the lamp itself seeming like a heavy fruit on a branch, laden with gently-shining fluorescent substances that often attract little animals of similarly soft temperament. It is said that this design comes from a certain plant within the rainforest, and that the uneven curvature of the vines and the lamp post highlights nature's beauty well indeed. There are still children who believe a certain fairy tale surrounding these lamp posts â€” which is that they are not man-made structures, but are instead \"lamp-trees\" that grew from seeds that the Forest Rangers planted.",
