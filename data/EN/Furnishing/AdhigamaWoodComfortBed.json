  "description": "A soft and comfortable Sumeru bed with an elegantly decorated Adhigama Wood bed frame, a mattress made from layers of high-quality fabric, clean sheets, and pillows made from dried flower petals. It is rumored that sleeping in this bed for the time a candle takes to burn would provide a whole night's worth of rest. This bed also prevents the usual back pains researchers get from constantly poring over books, and is the best choice for comfort and leisure.",
