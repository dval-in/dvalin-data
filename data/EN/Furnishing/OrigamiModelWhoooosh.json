  "description": "Tubby combined Paimon's description of your adventures in Simulanka with her own imagination to create this model of a vigorous origami flying squirrel. For some strange reason, whenever you look at the model, it feels like a gust of wind is blowing right into your face. So, why not ride the air currents and fly high into the sky like a flying squirrel when you get the chance?",
