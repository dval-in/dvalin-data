	"description": "A two-story storefront with an open plan and a sturdy platform made from Fragrant Cedar Wood. The overall design is quite similar to the main building of the Jiulue Teahouse in Yilong Wharf.\\nAmong architectural styles, the signature white walls and black roof tiles of Chenyu Vale are quite unique, and newcomers to the area are routinely astounded. If unsure where to begin a tour, the Jiulue Teahouse is an excellent place to begin. Starting from a cup of Single-Origin Yauwan or another local brew, tea is a superb guide to learning about Chenyu Vale.",
