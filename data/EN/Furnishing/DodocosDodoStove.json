	"description": "\"Some of the residents of Dodoland love to eat roasted apples. To make this dish, you'll have to slice the apples into large pieces and slather two servings of jam onto it...\"\\n\"Wait. Why roasted?\"\\n\"Well, that's because everyone in Dodoland is very warm-hearted, and so they love warm food!\"\\n\"And why do they put jam on the fruits?\"\\n\"That's because... This way, they can eat something that has different sorts of sweetness outside and inside. The sweeter the better!\"\\n...\\nAfter talking to Klee, who dropped by for a short visit, Tubby also attempted to make some of these roasted apples.\\nShe did wind up singeing some of her feathers as a result, but it was way worth it, because the apples were so good!",
