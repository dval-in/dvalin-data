When adventuring out in the wild, book knowledge may prove even more important than Mora.\\nIt's a shame that an author like Alice the Adventurer hasn't taken her wealth of expertise, summarized the essentials, and made it available in the form of a few slim pamphlets, because the only alternative is for other poor adventurers to carry around the burden of a thick stack of hefty hardbacks.",
