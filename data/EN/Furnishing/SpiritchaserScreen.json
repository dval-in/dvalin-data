  "description": "An exquisite racket made from Maple Wood. It originally had a symbolic meaning of \"warding off evil spirits,\" but is now better known as a kind of accessory. If you find a partner and a special ball, you can use them to play a ball game that is local to Inazuma. According to tradition, the winner can paint on the face of the loser with a brush. That is why you can always see a few children with ink on their faces at festivals.",
