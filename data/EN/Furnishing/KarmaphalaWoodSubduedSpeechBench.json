  "description": "Benches made from Karmaphala Wood. A few are scattered around specific outdoor areas in Sumeru City for people to use.\\nThese benches are wide and can support two people resting side by side, reducing the hassle of trying to find and borrow chairs. The proximity of the two parties also allows them to have a quieter conversation instead of disturbing other passers-by.",
