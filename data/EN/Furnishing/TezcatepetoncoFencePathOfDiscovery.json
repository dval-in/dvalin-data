  "description": "An arched fence adorned with unique patterns. Unlike typical fences, the Masters of the Night-Wind often design theirs in the shape of arches. This gateway-like design symbolizes both a \"boundary\" and a \"passage.\" When approaching the unknown, such as the mysteries of the arcane, the tribe first sets boundaries, then proceeds to explore cautiously. Some say these arch-shaped fences may symbolize the tribe's quest for knowledge and their exploration of the unknown.",
