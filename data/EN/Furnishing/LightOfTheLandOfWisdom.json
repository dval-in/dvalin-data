  "description": "This desk lamp from the House of Daena is made from the same material as that which comprises the Immersive Light street lamp. Its white and blue lampshades also possess a gorgeous design.\\nTo most, the brightness and intensity of this light seem unassuming. Not so different than an ordinary street lamp even. However, beyond what can be visually felt, this lamp is conducive to long-term reading and helps preserve ocular health to the utmost extent.",
