  "description": "A shield crafted from lightweight yet sturdy Athel Wood and metal components. Despite its size, it isn't excessively heavy and can be wielded with ease by any proficient warrior. Two sharp edges were purposely built onto the shield's top and bottom edges, allowing it to be used for not only defense, but also close-ranged attacks. This dual functionality earned it the name \"combat shield.\"\\nHowever, the Corps of Thirty and the Eremites recommend against its frequent usage due to the sheer difficulty of mastering this weapon.",
