  "description": "A common combination of drinking utensils in the taverns of Sumeru City. The flagons are cast with special metals and given a unique shape, with a plated layer within that can supposedly keep the liquor's flavor for a long time. However, some customers believe a good liquor's flavor will begin to dissipate the moment it is removed from the cask. Therefore, the unique properties of this flagon are no longer frequently mentioned.",
