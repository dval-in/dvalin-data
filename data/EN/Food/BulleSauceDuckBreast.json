The appetite evoked upon seeing it presented so beautifully seems to have disappeared equally as suddenly after your first bite.",

It's so irresistibly delicious that you can barely stop yourself from reaching for the next piece even before you've swallowed the last one. No matter how much Fontaine's food culture has evolved over the years, it's no surprise that this dish has always kept its place among the classics.",

Your initial apprehension quickly vanishes after experiencing its tender texture and refreshing aftertaste for yourself. Anyway, Clorinde already took a bite herself.
