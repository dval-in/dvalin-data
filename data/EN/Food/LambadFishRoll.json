  "description": "A grilled fish dish with a faint floral scent. It is said that Lambad once adventured far and wide in his youth. Everywhere he went, he would taste the grilled fish at local taverns. Lambad found it regrettable that this dish was not widely available in Sumeru, so he invented his own fish roll. According to the people who often dine at his tavern, the tales of his adventures aren't necessarily true, but his fish roll is undoubtedly delicious.",

The rolling golden fish meat and fragrant rose petals remind you of the billowing waves on the sea surface, colored crimson by the setting sun.
